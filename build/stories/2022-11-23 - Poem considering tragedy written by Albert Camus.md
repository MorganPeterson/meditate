Tragedy

Is when our hopes and dreams

Are dashed against the rocks

Of reality.

It is when we realize

That life is not always fair,

And that sometimes

The only thing we can do

Is to pick up the pieces

And try to move on.

Tragedy is when we lose

Someone we love,

And our world is forever changed.

It is a pain that never goes away,

But we must learn to live with it,

And to cherish the memories

We have of the ones we lost.
